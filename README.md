# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📊 Objective
Perform exploratory data analysis on the Titanic dataset to extract insights, visualize patterns, and understand survival factors.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- NumPy

## 📁 Dataset Used
- `train.csv` from the Titanic dataset (Kaggle)

## 🔍 EDA Steps Performed
1. **Data Overview**  
   - Used `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.value_counts()` to understand the structure and summary of the data.

2. **Missing Values Handling**  
   - `Age` filled with median  
   - `Embarked` filled with mode  
   - `Cabin` filled with "Unknown"

3. **Univariate Analysis**  
   - Histograms and count plots of `Sex`, `Age`, `Fare`, etc.

4. **Bivariate Analysis**  
   - Boxplots and grouped bar charts to explore relationships between features and survival.

5. **Skewed Data Handling**  
   - Applied log transformation to `Fare` to reduce skewness.

6. **Correlation & Multicollinearity**  
   - Heatmaps and pairplots to detect correlation  
   - Discussed VIF for multicollinearity detection

## 📌 Key Findings
- Female passengers had higher survival rates.
- 1st class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Younger passengers and those who paid higher fares had better survival chances.
- Embarked port 'C' showed higher survival rate.

## 📎 Files Included
- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with code and visuals
- `Titanic_EDA_Report.pdf` – PDF summary report of findings
- `train.csv` – Dataset used

## ✅ Outcome
- Developed deeper understanding of data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation.
- Practiced handling missing values, skewness, and multicollinearity.
